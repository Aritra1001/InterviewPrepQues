    <h3>1. Difference between div and span tag</h3>
    <p>
      Div is a block element. Div always start on the new line, and it will take
      whole width of the screen.
      <br />
      Span is an inline element. Span takes the space required for it, it does
      not occupy unnecessary width. Span does not start in a new line.
    </p>

    <div>Hi, good evening?</div>
    <div>My name is Aritra Nandi</div>
    <span>how are you guys?</span><span>Hope you are doing good.</span>

    <h3>2. Difference between class and IDs</h3>
    <p>
      IDs and class are selectors and are used to give name to element, using id
      and class we can target particular or multiple element respectively.
      <br />
      A Class name can be used by multiple HTML elements, while an ID name must
      only be used by one HTML element within the page. We denote classes with
      "." amd IDs with "#"
    </p>
    <!--<div class="class classes class1"></div>
    <span class="class classes class1"></span>
    <div id="container"></div> -->

      4. How many types of headings are there? How to decide which to use where?
    </h3>
    <p>
      There are 6 types of headings in HTML starting from h1 to h6.
      <br />
      h1 headings should be used for main headings, followed by h2 headings,
      then the less important h3 , and so on. We should use HTML headings for
      headings only and not use headings to make text BIG or bold.
    </p>

    <h3>5. Difference between block and inline</h3>
    <p>
      BLOCK- Block elements always start from a new line. Block elements cover
      space from left to right as far as it can go. Ex- div tag, h1 to h6,
      header, footer, section
      <br />
      INLINE- Inline elements never start from a new line. Inline elements only
      cover the space as bounded by the tags in the HTML element. Ex- span tag,
      anchor tag, strong tag, em tag
    </p>

    <h3>6. Difference between em and strong</h3>
    <p>
      The strong tag should be used to indicate strong importance, seriousness,
      or urgency, like to indicate key phrases in a text.
      <br />
      The em tag should be used to represent stress emphasis, like when you'd
      read the emphasized text in a different tone of voice.
    </p>

    <h3>7. What are attributes?</h3>
    <p>
      Attributes give additional information about the tag, it should be written
      in lower case letters omly it should be given in the opening tag always.
      Multiple attributes can be used in a particlar tag
